Project Description:
The number one problem that newly graduated college students face is finding a job, a problem that we are experiencing personally. Without knowing where to start, we eventually came across a platform by the name of LinkedIn.
 
LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet. You can use LinkedIn to find the right job or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills you need to succeed in your career. However, it can be difficult to connect with users who have 500+ connections, making it hard to get noticed. Other users could impersonate you, harming your professional identity. The premium package is severely costly, putting new graduates who may not be able to afford the price at a disadvantage.
 
We must deal with these countless worries on top of the stress of graduating on time, while also trying to connect with some of the more influential individuals running bigger companies. However, LinkedIn lessens my ability to connect with them, and rather lets me follow their page and see their postings.
 
Other social networking sites such as Monster, Indeed, Craigslist, Coffee Chat, and Lets Lunch are also great websites but suffer like LinkedIn. These other sites are not aesthetically pleasing, prone to scams, and provide no definite incentive for the individual.
 
We introduce Boggle.
 
Boggle is soon to be the first social networking platform that resolves the limitations that these companies have to offer. Boggle is your one stop shop.
 
Our mission statement is to connect people with their dream jobs and the employers that can make it happen.
 
Boggle will offer services that are both cost and time efficient. We aim to make an aesthetically pleasing website that is easily able to navigate. Boggle won’t require too much personal information, protecting user data and allowing employers to base intelligence solely on a person’s skills and qualifications.
 
The Boggle business model to generate revenue: 
Market more influential people that will use the network 
Celebrities 
Influential entrepreneurs 
Being able to pay an individual directly 
Through our website users are able to pay an individual directly to expedite services, ask questions, get advice, or propose business concepts. 
Users can be easily able to setup up online virtual conferences with an individual 
Charge big corporations to have their listings put on there to generate more revenue 
Rather than paying a monthly subscription to LinkedIn to potentially message 100’s of recruiters that may not reach back you, one can pay a small fee and will be put on top of the list, incentivizing the user and recipient and making it able to make a stronger connection with a particular individual
